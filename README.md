### ‚Ñπ About Me 

I'm a Millenial who saw the internet rising and started to learn how to "code" by tweaking HTML codes to customize my own blog templates as a teenager. Technology was always a personal interest of mine, but not my first career choice. I followed another personal interest of mine as a researcher in fertility for more than 10 years before I decided to transition to IT in 2022.

In just two years since switching careers, I have earned my Dutch language proficiency certificate and gained hands-on experience with multiple programming languages and frameworks, including C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Laravel, React, SQL, and Django. I love automating processes, making information accessible, and structuring data in a clear and intuitive way. 

Passion and curiosity have driven me to achieve a lot, both professionally and personally. Now that I‚Äôm working in the field of my lifelong special interest, I‚Äôm excited to grow, learn, and build even more.

- **Personal interests:** Stars, crochet, writing, fantasy, science
- **Professional interests:** Software development, automation of processes, design, data analyses, data management, AI
