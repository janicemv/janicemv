### ℹ About Me 

I'm a Millenial who saw the internet rising and started to learn how to "code" by tweaking HTML codes to customize my own blog templates as a teenager. Technology was always a personal interest of mine, but not my first career choice. I followed another personal interest of mine as a researcher in fertility for more than 10 years before I decided to transition to IT in 2022.

After one year of intensive Dutch lessons, I started to build my foundations in Computer Science with [Harvard's CS50 Online Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/). I am currently following a full-time course on Fullstack delopment with the support of the Belgian government.

- **Personal interests:** Stars, crochet, writing, fantasy, science
- **Professional interests:** Software development, automatization of processes, design, data analyses, data management
