### ℹ About Me 

Hi there! I'm a Millennial, approaching my 40s, who was always curious and passionate about technology. At 16, I started blogging, sharing my daily experiences and teenage thoughts. That's when I began experimenting with web design using Microsoft FrontPage, tweaking HTML codes, and learning by myself to customize my blog templates. This marked my first steps into coding.

My dream of working with dolphins led me to veterinary school, where I developed a passion for reproductive physiology. I pursued this through my Master's, PhD, and post-doctoral research (though not with dolphins!). My career brought me amazing collaborations and the opportunity to move from Brazil to Belgium, where I live now with my husband and our two kids. Despite my accomplishments, the demands of academia and my growing family made me reconsider my path, a contemplation that had first emerged during my PhD studies, ten years before.

In 2022, I started transitioning to IT. After completing my Dutch lessons, I followed some online programming courses. [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) was fundamental to build a sold foundation in Computer Science. After finishing it, I started a programming course with the support from the Belgian government, which is currently my main occupation (together, of course, with raising the kids and all the rest 🥰).

- 🌟 Fun fact: I'm passionate about stars! This special interest is now part of my coding exercises as well. :)
